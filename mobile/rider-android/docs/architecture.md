# Rider Android Architecture

## Overview
This document details the architecture of the Rider Android App. The project follows MVVM/MVC principles to separate concerns and facilitate unit testing, continuous integration, and scalability.

## Key Modules
- **MainActivity:** Entry point; provides navigation to booking, map, payment, and user management.
- **Booking Module:** Manages the ride booking flow.
- **Map Module:** Integrates Google Maps SDK for real-time location and routing.
- **Payment Module:** Handles payment processing UI and integrates with backend payment APIs.
- **User Module:** Manages user profile and account settings.
- **Common Module:** Shared utilities, base activities, and error handling.

## Design Guidelines
- **Consistency:** Use shared resources (strings, colors, dimensions) for consistency.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure all components are accessible, with proper content descriptions.
- **Localization:** All text resources are stored in strings.xml for easy localization.
- **Modularity:** Each module is developed as an independent unit to ease maintenance and scaling.

## CI/CD Integration
- **Automated Testing:** Unit tests and UI tests are integrated with GitHub Actions.
- **Deployment:** Uses Gradle and Fastlane for build automation and deployment.
