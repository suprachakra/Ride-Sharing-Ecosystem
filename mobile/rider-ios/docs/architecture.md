# Rider iOS Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the architecture of the Rider iOS app, emphasizing a modular design using Swift and UIKit. It follows best practices for code reusability, accessibility, and localization.

## Modules
- **AppDelegate:** Initializes the application and sets up the initial navigation stack.
- **Booking Module:** Contains the BookingViewController for ride booking.
- **Map Module:** Uses MapKit for displaying maps; can be extended to use Google Maps SDK.
- **Payment Module:** Manages payment UI and integrates with backend payment processing.
- **User Module:** Handles user account management.
- **Common Module:** Shared utilities and base classes (e.g., BaseViewController for common behavior).

## Design Guidelines
- **Consistency:** All view controllers inherit from BaseViewController.
- **Accessibility:** UI elements are labeled and support dynamic type.
- **Localization:** All strings are managed through Localizable.strings files.
- **Testing:** Unit tests are written using XCTest.

## CI/CD Integration
- Use Fastlane for automated builds and deployments.
- Integrate with GitHub Actions for continuous integration.
