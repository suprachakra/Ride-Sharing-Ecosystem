# Ridesharing Marketplace Ecosystem

**Context:**  
We are developing a cutting-edge ridesharing marketplace pricing strategy—transitioning from a traditional zone-based surge model to a more granular and intelligent cell-based approach, eventually incorporating advanced AI-driven pricing. This approach not only improves operational metrics but also aligns deeply with brand values, compliance needs, and user satisfaction goals.

---

### 1. Executive Summary & Vision

**High-Level Vision:**  
We aim to create a ridesharing marketplace that achieves **exceptional reliability, fairness, and adaptability** in pricing, ensuring that riders receive transparent, predictable fares and drivers earn stable, attractive incomes. By leveraging a cell-based (H3 hexagonal) infrastructure and evolving from baseline models (akin to V1) to more mathematically optimized (V2) and ultimately AI-driven models (V3), we will continuously refine our surge pricing logic. Every improvement is validated through data-driven experiments, user feedback loops, and compliance checks, ensuring a safe, ethical, and user-centric experience.

**Strategic Imperatives:**
- **Outcome-Focused:** Improve key metrics (e.g., On-Time Performance, NPS) through precisely tuned surge pricing—directly tying each feature to measurable OKRs.
- **Transparent & Trustworthy:** Provide riders with clear “Why this fare?” explanations and ensure driver incentive dashboards foster trust and reduce turnover.
- **Agile & Scalable:** Align with SAFe increments; begin with pilot tests in selected areas, scale up iteratively as KPIs meet thresholds, and maintain compliance in all expansions.
- **Data-Driven & Adaptive:** Employ continuous A/B tests, pilot rollouts, feedback sessions, and iterative model retraining to ensure long-term success and responsiveness to market changes.

**Why It Matters:**  
This approach sets a high benchmark: a marketplace strategy that preempts stakeholder questions (“What if regulatory changes occur?” “How do we ensure fairness?”) and offers ready solutions—circuit breakers for price spikes, compliance dashboards, ML model drift alerts, and communication protocols for user education. By achieving operational excellence and delighting both riders and drivers, we strengthen our competitive position and future-proof the business against evolving market conditions.

**Key Artifacts:**  
- *UX Mockups*: High-fidelity prototypes for rider surge explanation screens and driver incentive dashboards (accessible via internal design repository).  
- *High-Level Architectural Diagram*: Shows microservices for pricing, dispatch, compliance, and data pipelines (maintained in engineering wiki).  
- *Data Governance & ML Model Overview*: Documents outlining ETL jobs, schema evolution policies, and ML retraining triggers (in data team’s Confluence pages).

## 4. Product & Marketplace Strategy

**Strategic Pillars:**
1. **Dynamic, Data-Driven Pricing & Dispatch:**  
   - ML-based surge pricing recalculated every 5 minutes.  
   - Predict driver shortages (≥10% shortfall triggers targeted driver incentives via push notifications).
   - WSJF used to prioritize pricing algorithm improvements over less impactful features if KPIs lag.

2. **Trust & Safety Integration:**  
   - Driver onboarding includes ID verification, background checks (API integration with third-party screening).  
   - In-app safety: SOS button tested in pilot city; if incidents resolve 20% faster, implement globally.  
   - Compliance dashboard: Alerts if local reg changes. If new driver license rule emerges, adapt within 2 weeks.

3. **Transparent & Intuitive UX:**  
   - Riders see a breakdown: base fare, time/distance, surge multiplier + educational tooltip.  
   - Drivers get a weekly “peak hours” suggestion card; A/B test if adding visual heatmaps reduces idle time by 10%.

4. **Scalability & Localization:**  
   - Microservices architecture allows plugging in local payment methods in <2 weeks.  
   - Localization team aligns content and support scripts to regional preferences; test localized approach in City B pilot and measure adoption.

5. **Continuous Improvement & Iteration:**  
   - Sprint-level adjustments via Inspect & Adapt sessions each PI.  
   - If after PI-1 on-time +5% target not met, run a root cause analysis (maybe increase incentive budget or tweak ML hyperparameters).

**Sample WSJF Example:**  
- Surge Algorithm Improvement (A) vs. Cosmetic UI Change (B):  
  - A expected to improve on-time by 3% vs. B’s 0.5% user delight increment. A receives higher WSJF score, prioritized in next PI.

## 6. Detailed Requirements (FRs, NFRs, User Stories, Acceptance Criteria)

### Functional Requirements (FRs) (Selected Examples):

1. **FR1 (Surge Algorithm):**  
   - System recalculates surge multipliers every 5 minutes based on real-time supply/demand.  
   - Processing latency <2s.  
   - If predicted rider demand outpaces driver supply by >10%, surge factor increases incrementally (max cap defined by local regulation).

2. **FR2 (Driver Forecasting):**  
   - Predict supply needs 30 min ahead. If shortfall >10%, send push notifications to off-duty drivers.  
   - Track how many drivers respond to these alerts. If response <5%, consider increasing incentive amount automatically.

3. **FR3 (Background Checks):**  
   - On driver sign-up, integrate with external API for background checks.  
   - If fail, block activation and notify compliance officer.  
   - Re-verify driver background every 6 months automatically.

4. **FR4 (Fare Transparency UI):**  
   - Rider app displays cost breakdown (base fare, distance fare, surge multiplier, estimated total).  
   - Show “?” icon next to surge: tapping opens a tooltip explaining surge logic.  
   - A/B test: In test group, show a short video snippet (10s) explaining surge. If abandonment reduces by >2%, roll out video snippet widely.

5. **FR5 (ETL & Data Quality):**  
   - Run nightly ETL. If discrepancy >1%, trigger remediation job and alert data steward via Slack.  
   - Store monthly ETL error reports in Confluence with root cause analysis. If recurring error >3 times, escalate to Data Engineering Manager.

6. **FR6 (Localization):**  
   - Adding a new language (strings in resource files) and payment method (API integration) should take <2 weeks from request to production.  
   - Test localized UI with a user pilot: if comprehension scores <90% in user tests, refine translations before city launch.

### Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs):

- **Performance:** Critical actions (request ride, assign driver, pricing calc) respond <2s at 10x peak load.
- **Scalability:** Support 100k drivers & 1M daily rides by Year 2.  
- **Security & Compliance:** OAuth 2.0 auth, encrypted data at rest and transit, quarterly pen tests.  
- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance (keyboard navigation verified, color contrast checked via automated tools like Axe).

## 7. Data & Analytics Integration

**Scope:** Ensure data pipelines, ML models, ETL processes, and analytics tools deliver accurate, timely insights to guide decision-making, evaluate OKRs, and continuously refine marketplace performance.

**Data Sources & Governance:**  
- **Core Data Inputs:** Rider requests, driver statuses (online/offline, trip states), pricing events, trip completions, ratings, support tickets, regulatory and compliance events, external feeds (weather, traffic).  
- **ETL Processes:**  
  - Nightly ETL job transforms raw event logs into structured trip tables, driver performance summaries, and rider usage metrics.  
  - Schema evolution handled via versioned schemas stored in a data catalog (e.g., in a Data Dictionary on Confluence). Any schema changes require Data Steward approval, automatic backward compatibility checks.  
  - If discrepancy >1% in ETL run, remediation job triggers. Data Engineering logs root cause and fixes within 24h.

**ML Model Governance:**  
- **Model Types:** Surge prediction models, driver supply forecasting, ETA accuracy models.  
- **MLOps Pipeline:**  
  - Retrain surge model monthly or if MAE >10% for 3 consecutive days.  
  - Store model versions in a model registry, label them by deployment date and test results.  
  - Automated drift detection: If predicted vs. actual supply differs by >5% for a week, alert Data Scientist to review model features (e.g., might add weather data if not already included).

**A/B Testing & Advanced Analytics:**  
- **A/B Test Framework:**  
  - Randomly assign subsets of riders/drivers to test variants (e.g., different incentive schemes or surge explanations).  
  - Collect metrics (abandonment rate, earnings stability, time-to-complete rides) and run statistical significance tests.  
- **User Behavior Analytics:**  
  - Heatmaps of driver availability vs. rider request density displayed in internal dashboards (Tableau or Looker) to guide city operations teams.  
  - NPS tracking monthly; if NPS stagnates, run correlation analysis to see if price complexity or safety concerns are impacting satisfaction.

**Artifacts/References:**  
- Data Dictionary: Lists all data tables, fields, and lineage diagrams accessible via internal Confluence.  
- ML Model Documentation: MLOps pipeline described in Engineering/ML wiki, including hyperparameter defaults, retraining triggers, and fallback models.

## 8. Engineering & Architecture Overview

**High-Level Architecture:**  
- **Microservices:** Pricing service, dispatch service, compliance service, payment gateway integration, driver onboarding service, rider app backend, notification service for incentives.  
- **APIs & Contracts:**  
  - Versioned APIs with backward compatibility guaranteed for 2 releases.  
  - API contracts documented in OpenAPI specs (see Engineering repo “api-specs/”).  
  - Performance budgets: Each API responds <200ms under normal load, <500ms under 10x peak.

**CI/CD & Tooling:**  
- Code repos: GitHub monorepo with separate directories for each microservice.  
- CI Pipeline: GitHub Actions runs unit, integration tests on each commit; merge to main requires passing all tests & code review by 2 peers.  
- CD Pipeline: Argo CD for automated deployments to staging & prod after approvals in monthly release windows.

**Performance & Scalability Measures:**  
- **Caching:** Redis caching for frequently accessed data (e.g., pricing lookups).  
- **Autoscaling:** Kubernetes HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler) scaling services up/down based on CPU/memory metrics and custom latency thresholds.  
- **Disaster Recovery:**  
  - Multi-region deployment: If primary region fails, failover to secondary within RTO <4h.  
  - DR drills quarterly; last DR drill revealed a DNS misconfiguration, fixed immediately.

**Security & Compliance:**  
- OAuth 2.0 for auth, all tokens short-lived.  
- Data encryption (AES-256 at rest, TLS in transit).  
- Quarterly pen tests by an external security firm; track findings in Security Jira board.

## 9. QA & Test Automation

**Test Strategies:**  
- **Unit Tests:** ≥90% coverage, mocking external dependencies.  
- **Integration Tests:** Validate end-to-end flows (request ride → driver assigned → trip complete → payment). For example, a test simulates a peak-hour scenario and checks if surge pricing and driver notifications work as intended.  
- **System Integration Testing (SIT):** Conducted pre-MVP and before major releases, SIT includes load tests with 10x normal traffic and simulated external API delays.

**UAT & Pilot Tests:**  
- **UAT:** Invite a select group of riders/drivers from pilot city to test new features, gather qualitative feedback. If UAT reveals confusion about incentive UI, adjust before global launch.  
- **Alpha/Beta Testing:** Run alpha in a closed test group (internal employees), beta in one pilot city. If beta feedback indicates -5% driver satisfaction, fix issues before scaling globally.

**Performance & Security Testing:**  
- Monthly load tests. If response times exceed 2s at peak, add caching or refine queries.  
- Security: Automated scans (Snyk for dependencies, Zap for dynamic scans), pen tests quarterly.

**Accessibility Testing:**  
- Automated scans with Axe on staging builds. Manual tests with screen readers. If critical WCAG violations found, block release until resolved.

**Artifacts/References:**  
- Test Plan Document: Details test scopes, test tools (Selenium for UI, JMeter for load), stored in QA repo “test-plans/2023-q2/”.  
- Defect Management: Jira board “MARKETPLACE-DEFECTS” tracking severity, SLA for fixes (P1 fix within 24h).

---

## 10. Branding, UX & CX Alignment

**Brand Principles:**  
- Reliability, fairness, innovation. The UI should reflect a trusted, friendly tone: no confusing jargon.  
- Color Scheme: Brand-approved palette (e.g., blue for reliability, green accents for “go” signals). Typography per Brand Style Guide (Montserrat font, consistent iconography).

**UX Validation:**  
- Monthly usability tests with at least 5 riders and 5 drivers. If testing surge explanation, we record time-to-understand pricing. If ≥80% understand within 10s, good to proceed. If <80%, simplify wording or add an animation.

**Consistent CX Across Touchpoints:**  
- Support scripts aligned with brand tone: empathetic, concise.  
- Marketing emails follow brand guidelines (logo, tagline, consistent tone). If a PR crisis (e.g., safety incident) occurs, use pre-approved crisis messaging templates to maintain trust.

**Artifacts/References:**  
- Brand Style Guide: In “brand-guide/” repository with color codes, logo usage rules.  
- UX Mockups & Prototypes: Figma links in “design/ux-prototypes/rider_surge_explainer.fig”.

**A/B Testing for UX:**  
- If adding a new driver incentive icon, split test icon A vs. icon B. If B leads to 5% higher driver follow-through, adopt B.

---

## 11. Marketing & GTM Integration

**GTM Goals:**  
- Increase rider adoption and driver sign-ups in pilot city by 10% pre-MVP.  
- Educate riders on surge logic, improving acceptance of surge rides by at least 2% post-launch.
- Post-MVP, run referral campaigns: track referral conversion. If referrals add 5% more riders in a month, scale promotion.

**GTM Channels & Collateral:**  
- **Pre-Launch Campaigns:**  
  - Blog posts explaining new surge logic.  
  - Short video ads on social media (30s animations showing how we ensure fair pricing).
- **Launch Week Promotions:**  
  - Rider discounts during peak times to test price elasticity. If ridership +10% at peak hours, consider making discounts periodic.  
  - Driver sign-up bonuses: If driver supply in new city lags, increase bonus by 20% until target supply met.

**Brand & Marketing Alignment:**  
- All marketing materials reviewed by Brand Manager for tone and consistency.  
- Crisis Management: If a safety incident goes public, we have a PR template ready—acknowledge issue, outline steps taken, reaffirm safety commitment. Test messaging on internal teams first.

**Measuring GTM Success:**  
- Track CTR on blog posts, social ads. If CTR <1%, adjust messaging or targeting.  
- Measure NPS uplift quarterly. If after 3 months NPS < +3 points (vs. target +10), investigate if marketing messages are unclear or incentives inadequate.

**Artifacts/References:**  
- Marketing Calendar: “marketing/campaigns/q3_plan.xlsx” with exact dates for emails, social posts.  
- Messaging Framework: “marketing/messaging_framework.md” detailing core value props and taglines.

## 12. Operations & Compliance Considerations

**Driver Onboarding & Verification:**  
- Steps: ID upload → background check API call → insurance validation → compliance officer review if needed. If fail steps, driver receives automated rejection email with next steps.
- Target onboarding time: <24h from submission to final decision. If backlog grows, add temporary ops support or automate certain checks.

**Support & Escalation Protocols:**  
- Tiered Support:  
  - L1 handles FAQs (ETAs, payment issues).  
  - L2 handles complex disputes (fare disputes, missed incentives).  
  - L3 (Legal/Compliance) handles regulatory or safety incidents.  
- SLA: L1 resolves 80% tickets <2h. If >5% tickets escalate to L2 due to unclear policies, revise L1 training materials.

**Regulatory Adaptation:**  
- Maintain a compliance backlog: If new law demands driver medical checks, add Medical Check Feature to compliance epic. Target adaptation in <2 weeks.
- Monitor local news feeds. If strike or festival predicted, pre-emptively adjust incentives or limit surge cap to comply with temporary local govt directives.

**Artifacts/References:**  
- Compliance Dashboard: “ops/compliance_dashboard” with live alerts, driver doc status reports.
- Support Playbook: “ops/support_playbook.pdf” detailing escalation steps and response templates.

## 13. Risk Management & Trade-Offs

**Key Risks & Mitigations:**

| Risk                                   | Mitigation                                                             |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Integration failures with external APIs | Sandbox testing pre-launch; fallback pricing logic if external API down |
| ML model underperformance               | Monthly retraining, drift detection alerts, rollback to previous stable model |
| Low user adoption                       | Additional tutorials, refine UI, increase driver/rider promotions, do targeted interviews to identify friction points |
| Regulatory changes                      | Modular compliance rules, 2-week SLA to adapt, maintain legal templates |
| Performance bottlenecks                 | Autoscaling, caching, monthly load tests. If tests show response >2s, invest in DB indexing or rewrite slow queries |

**Trade-Off Examples:**
- **Speed vs. Feature Completeness:** Better to pilot fewer features with high reliability than launch many half-baked. If MVP date nears and surge UI animation not stable, launch with text tooltip only.
- **Cost vs. Earnings Stability:** If driver turnover too high, slightly increase incentive budget short-term. Test if turnover drops; if yes, keep higher incentives until ML suggests stable supply.

**Scenario Handling:**
- If after 2 months on-time improvement <3% (vs. 5% target), run a root cause workshop. Maybe surge thresholds too low—adjust model or expand driver incentives.  
- If local government in City B caps surge at 1.2x, adapt pricing service in <2 weeks, test compliance with simulated requests.

## 14. Roadmap & Timelines (SAFe-Aligned)

| PI (2.5 Months) | Key Deliverables                                  | Goals & Metrics                                                |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| PI-1 (Months 1-2.5) | Basic surge (F-01), partial safety checks (F-02), pilot city A/B test for pricing UI | Validate feasibility, +5% on-time in pilot city after 1 month |
| PI-2 (Months 2.5-5) | Enhanced surge model (F-03), driver dashboard (F-04), ETAs refined, first data pipeline QA pass | On-time +10%, wait times -8%, stable ETL (<1% errors) |
| MVP (Month 5)   | Launch MVP company-wide, run initial marketing push, training done | Achieve +5% on-time co-wide in 1 month, NPS +3 pts vs baseline |
| PI-3 (Months 5-7.5)| Advanced safety features (F-05), first city expansion (#1), improved compliance processes | Zero violations, stable performance in new city, driver turnover -5% |
| PI-4 (Months 7.5-10)| Predictive analytics (F-06), 2 more city expansions (#2 & #3), marketing campaigns | Predictive accuracy >80%, NPS +10 total, 3 cities live |
| PI-5 (Months 10-12.5)| Optimize ML models (F-07), scaling enhancements, add local payment methods, refine brand messaging | Sustain 95% on-time, driver turnover -15%, stable brand perception |

**Inspect & Adapt Each PI:**  
If at PI-1 end on-time gain <3%, re-prioritize next features (improve surge model or driver incentives first?). If expansions show regulatory hurdles, assign dedicated compliance sprints.

---

## 15. Iteration & Feedback Loops

**Mechanisms for Continuous Improvement:**
- **Pilot Tests:** Start each new feature in one pilot city. If results positive (≥5% improvement in metric), scale next PI.
- **A/B Tests:** For each significant UI or incentive change, run A/B test for 2 weeks, measure statistical significance (p<0.05). If variant outperforms control by ≥2% on target metric, adopt it.
- **User Interviews & Surveys:** Monthly sessions with a rotating panel of riders & drivers. Track qualitative feedback in Miro boards. If recurring complaints about surge fairness emerge, prioritize next sprint to improve explanations.
- **Backlog Refinement with WSJF:** Quarterly WSJF scoring sessions align features to outcomes. If a low-value cosmetic feature competes with a predictive analytics improvement that can boost on-time rates, pick the analytics improvement first.
- **Data-Driven Decision-Making:** Ongoing correlation analysis between NPS and metrics like wait times or pricing. If correlation shows pricing transparency strongly tied to NPS, allocate more resources to simplifying price UI next PI.

**Artifacts/References:**  
- Feedback Repository: “product/feedback_log.md” logs user comments, A/B test results, pilot outcomes.  
- Backlog in Jira: Contains WSJF scores for top 20 features each quarter.
