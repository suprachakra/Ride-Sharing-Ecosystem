# Ridesharing Marketplace Ecosystem

**Context:**  
We are developing a cutting-edge ridesharing marketplace pricing strategy—transitioning from a traditional zone-based surge model to a more granular and intelligent cell-based approach, eventually incorporating advanced AI-driven pricing. This approach not only improves operational metrics but also aligns deeply with brand values, compliance needs, and user satisfaction goals.

---

### 1. Executive Summary & Vision

**High-Level Vision:**  
We aim to create a ridesharing marketplace that achieves **exceptional reliability, fairness, and adaptability** in pricing, ensuring that riders receive transparent, predictable fares and drivers earn stable, attractive incomes. By leveraging a cell-based (H3 hexagonal) infrastructure and evolving from baseline models (akin to V1) to more mathematically optimized (V2) and ultimately AI-driven models (V3), we will continuously refine our surge pricing logic. Every improvement is validated through data-driven experiments, user feedback loops, and compliance checks, ensuring a safe, ethical, and user-centric experience.

**Strategic Imperatives:**
- **Outcome-Focused:** Improve key metrics (e.g., On-Time Performance, NPS) through precisely tuned surge pricing—directly tying each feature to measurable OKRs.
- **Transparent & Trustworthy:** Provide riders with clear “Why this fare?” explanations and ensure driver incentive dashboards foster trust and reduce turnover.
- **Agile & Scalable:** Align with SAFe increments; begin with pilot tests in selected areas, scale up iteratively as KPIs meet thresholds, and maintain compliance in all expansions.
- **Data-Driven & Adaptive:** Employ continuous A/B tests, pilot rollouts, feedback sessions, and iterative model retraining to ensure long-term success and responsiveness to market changes.

**Why It Matters:**  
This approach sets a high benchmark: a marketplace strategy that preempts stakeholder questions (“What if regulatory changes occur?” “How do we ensure fairness?”) and offers ready solutions—circuit breakers for price spikes, compliance dashboards, ML model drift alerts, and communication protocols for user education. By achieving operational excellence and delighting both riders and drivers, we strengthen our competitive position and future-proof the business against evolving market conditions.

**Key Artifacts:**  
- *UX Mockups*: High-fidelity prototypes for rider surge explanation screens and driver incentive dashboards (accessible via internal design repository).  
- *High-Level Architectural Diagram*: Shows microservices for pricing, dispatch, compliance, and data pipelines (maintained in engineering wiki).  
- *Data Governance & ML Model Overview*: Documents outlining ETL jobs, schema evolution policies, and ML retraining triggers (in data team’s Confluence pages).

### 2. Market & User Insights

**Market Landscape & Competitive Context:**  
The ridesharing industry is crowded and dynamic. Competitors employ various surge pricing strategies—some rely on simpler zone-based logic, others already experiment with granular, data-driven approaches. Standing out requires not just better modeling but robust transparency, trustworthy brand positioning, and rapid adaptability to local regulatory and cultural conditions. For instance, one competitor might handle rain-induced demand spikes simply by capping surges, while another might fail to explain price hikes, alienating riders. Our advantage will come from balancing precision and fairness, supported by transparent UX and compliance mechanisms, ensuring we capture both rider trust and driver loyalty.

**User Segments & Their Nuanced Needs:**
- **Riders:**  
  - **Current Pain:** Confusion during off-peak hours if prices remain inexplicably high, or frustration if a sudden rain event doesn’t adjust prices fast enough, resulting in missed opportunities or switching to a competitor. Lack of clarity erodes trust.  
  - **Rider Need:** Clear, upfront reasoning for fares (“Why this fare?”), stable ETAs, assurance that the platform responds ethically and promptly to changing conditions (like heavy rain or sudden demand clusters in a particular neighborhood).
  
- **Drivers:**  
  - **Current Pain:** Struggle with earnings volatility; if prices remain too low during sudden demand spikes (due to previously lowered surge caps), drivers feel undervalued and may prefer competitor platforms offering quicker earnings upticks. Complexity in incentive rules also confuses them.  
  - **Driver Need:** Predictable income guidance, intuitive dashboards that highlight when/where driving is most profitable, and transparent incentive parameters that adjust fairly with real conditions.

**Insights from Interviews, Surveys, and A/B Tests:**
- Rider interviews show that a well-explained surge rationale (e.g., a tooltip or 10-second in-app explainer video) can reduce abandonment by ~2%. While that 2% seems small, at scale it’s meaningful revenue and improved brand reputation.  
- Driver focus groups and pilot tests suggest that providing weekly peak-hour forecasts and clear incentive structures can reduce driver turnover by up to 10%, stabilizing supply and thus improving on-time performance.
- Market research indicates that localizing parameters (like adapting surge thresholds for specific neighborhoods or adjusting feature_flag for test zones) can capture local market nuances. For instance, certain areas respond positively to slight fare increases if well explained, while others require maintaining strict surge caps to avoid backlash.

**Opportunities:**
- Implementing a cell-based model (V1 baseline, evolving to V2, and ultimately V3 with ML) allows fine-grained control over pricing, addressing identified pain points directly.  
- Coupling this pricing evolution with transparent explanations and fallback logic (feature_flag=0 for old logic, feature_flag=1 for new logic in certain zones, test intervals defined by start_time/end_time) ensures we can respond quickly if early tests show negative rider or driver feedback.  
- Integrating rainfall and price search data (previously not collected) offers richer context. E.g., if heavy rain spikes demand and we fail to raise prices appropriately in old logic, we can switch to the new logic or adjust parameters mid-PI to prevent losing drivers to competitors.

These insights feed directly into our OKRs and strategy, ensuring every decision is grounded in validated user needs and market realities.

---

### 3. Objectives & Key Results (OKRs)

We set OKRs to ensure that every feature, parameter tweak, and fallback decision ties directly to measurable outcomes. These OKRs are not static: if we fail to meet targets, we adjust strategy, backlog, or parameters (like unmet_rate thresholds or surge_high_tier_rate) in subsequent increments.

| Objective                                | Key Result                                                                      |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Improve On-Time Performance (OKR1)        | Increase on-time pickups from 85% to 95% in 6 months                           |
| Enhance Operational Efficiency (OKR2)     | Reduce average rider wait times by 15% within 4 months                         |
| Strengthen Compliance & Safety (OKR3)     | Zero regulatory violations for 6 continuous months; 100% driver background checks |
| Elevate User Satisfaction (OKR4)          | Increase NPS by +10 points in 2 quarters, reduce driver turnover by 15%         |
| Ensure Scalable Growth (OKR5)             | Expand to 3 new cities in 6 months while maintaining ≥90% on-time rates          |

**Real-World Validation & Iterative Adjustments:**
- **If On-Time Improvement <3% After Pilot Tests (OKR1)**:  
  Evaluate parameters (unmet_rate1, unmet_rate2, additional_surge_high) or revert feature_flag=0 for certain test zones. Next PI, prioritize surge algorithm refinement (WSJF scoring favors features with higher impact on on-time). Possibly run more A/B tests isolating rainfall data’s effect.
  
- **If NPS Stagnates After 2 Months (OKR4)**:  
  Run user interviews focusing on surge explanation clarity. If confusion persists, try adding a short educational animation or simpler wording. Re-run A/B tests: if the animation variant improves comprehension and reduces abandonment, adopt it globally next increment.
  
- **If a Compliance Violation Occurs (OKR3)**:  
  Immediately revert to old logic or apply stricter surge caps in that zone. Update compliance configs within 2 weeks, re-audit the logic next increment.
  
- **If Growth Targets Lag (OKR5)**:  
  Before scaling beyond pilot zones, re-check local preferences. Maybe low adoption in a new city requires adjusting surge_high_tier_rate downward or extending test durations. If compliance or branding concerns arise (like negative press due to surge confusion), address them first.

By linking outcomes to data-driven decision-making, we ensure no “What if?” scenario is ignored. Each KPI acts as a gate: if not met, do not scale or proceed; refine first.

---

### 4. Product & Marketplace Strategy

Our strategy rests on iterative refinement, data-driven insights, and the capacity to adapt swiftly if results deviate from targets. We integrate SAFe alignment, cross-functional input (Data, QA, Branding, Marketing, Compliance, Engineering), and scenario-based fallback logic to ensure resilience.

**Strategic Pillars:**

1. **Incremental Model Evolution (V1 → V2 → V3):**  
   - **V1 (Baseline):** Parameter-heavy, derived from expert knowledge. Good starting point to test cell-level logic in controlled zones (e.g., zone_id = 51, 4 with a feature_flag=1). If pilot shows partial success (on-time +3% but NPS flat), adjust parameters or revert to old logic for a subset of hours.  
   - **V2 (Mathematical Simplification):** After validating V4, switch to a simpler, fewer-parameter model that’s easier to tune and scale. A/B test V5.1 vs. V4 in pilot zones; if V5.1 improves operational efficiency by an additional 2% and reduces driver confusion, adopt V5.1 in more zones next increment.  
   - **Future V3 (AI-Driven ML):** Once enough data is collected (at least 6 months of cell-level data, including rainfall, price searches), introduce ML-based surge predictions. If ML tests reveal bias or complexity issues, revert to V5.1 temporarily, retrain ML, and re-test.

2. **SAFe Alignment & Iterative Validation:**
   Each Program Increment (PI) focuses on a set of features and pilot tests. After PI-1, if no significant improvement, reprioritize backlog (using WSJF) toward features (like adjusting unmet_rate thresholds) or UX enhancements. Inspect & Adapt sessions after each PI incorporate user feedback (from brand surveys, compliance checks, QA reports) and pilot data into immediate next steps.

3. **Robust Fallback & Compliance Integration:**
   The presence of a feature_flag means we can revert to old logic if a new model or parameter set causes rider dissatisfaction, compliance risks, or negative brand impact. For instance, if heavy rain hits and the new logic fails to raise prices adequately (losing drivers to competitors), we can quickly tweak additional_surge_high or revert to old logic for a set period defined by start_time/end_time. If a local regulation emerges capping surge at 1.2x, compliance rules feed into pricing logic instantly; if a violation is detected, old logic acts as a safety net while we reconfigure parameters.

4. **Cross-Functional Integration (Brand, Data, QA, Marketing, Ops, Compliance):**
   - **Data:** Powers the shift from V4 to V5.1 and eventually V5.2 by collecting richer contextual data (rain, price search patterns) and ensuring no ETL discrepancies.  
   - **QA:** Validates performance under load, ensures accessibility and security before each rollout. If test fails, block release until resolved.  
   - **Brand & UX:** Ensures that each increment of model improvement also includes refined rider/driver communications. If brand tests show confusion, add educational tooltips next PI.  
   - **Marketing & GTM:** Align pilot rollouts with user messaging campaigns. If marketing finds low user adoption, test new explanatory material or promotions in next increment.  
   - **Compliance & Ops:** Rapidly adjust parameters or revert logic if new regulations appear or if compliance violations arise. If expansions to a new city yield unexpected cultural barriers, refine localized logic, re-check brand messaging, and retest.

**Outcome-Focus & Real-World Checks:**
The entire strategy revolves around outcome validation:

- If after a pilot (2-week test in selected zones), no KPI improvements meet targets, do not scale further. Instead, refine, retest, or revert.  
- Continuous feedback loops (weekly user interviews, monthly NPS surveys, pen tests, load tests each PI) ensure no stagnation.  
- Each decision is not final; it’s a hypothesis tested in real conditions. If outcomes fail, we adapt swiftly, making the entire approach highly resilient and future-proof.

### 5. Epics, Features, and Hierarchy

**Epics & Their Justification:**  
Each Epic directly supports OKRs and strategic pillars by addressing rider/driver needs, ensuring compliance, enhancing data capabilities, scaling operations, and maintaining brand trust.

| Epic ID | Epic Name                         | Strategic/Outcome Alignment                                     |
|---------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| E-01    | Dynamic Pricing & Dispatch         | Directly improves on-time performance (OKR1) and efficiency (OKR2). Cell-based pricing (V4→V5.1→V5.2) with parameters & feature_flag provides granular, testable control and quick fallback if pilots fail. |
| E-02    | Transparency & UX Enhancements     | Increases NPS (OKR4) by reducing rider confusion. “Why this fare?” explanations and A/B-tested UI changes ensure trust and fairness. If metrics don’t improve, pivot messaging next increment. |
| E-03    | Driver Incentive Optimization      | Reduces driver turnover (OKR4) by offering stable earning forecasts and intuitive dashboards. If driver satisfaction <80%, adjust incentive display logic or add visuals next PI. |
| E-04    | Data Governance & ML Readiness     | Critical for future AI-driven pricing (OKR5), ensuring data accuracy and integrity. If ETL errors >1%, fix before next release. Data collected now supports future ML (V5.2) improvements. |
| E-05    | Compliance & Risk Mitigation       | Ensures zero violations (OKR3) and quick adaptation to local laws. If a new rule appears, implement in <2 weeks or revert to old logic. Regular compliance checks prevent brand/reputational damage. |
| E-06    | Marketing & GTM Integration         | Drives user adoption and brand message alignment, supporting efficiency/NPS improvements. If marketing campaigns fail (e.g., CTR <1%), test alternate messaging or promotions next PI. |
| E-07    | QA & Test Automation Framework     | Indirectly supports all OKRs by preventing regressions. Comprehensive testing (performance, security, accessibility) ensures stable deployments. If tests fail, block release, fix defects, retest. |
| E-08    | Scalability & Localization          | Essential for expansions (OKR5). Localizing payment methods, languages, and compliance rules. If a city launch fails KPI targets, refine local parameters, re-test before further rollout. |
| E-09    | Compliance & Risk Management        | Rapidly adapt pricing rules to new regulations or user backlash. Fallback logic (feature_flag=0) ensures we never linger in a non-compliant or user-unfriendly state. |

**Feature Examples Under E-01 (Dynamic Pricing):**
- F-01: Baseline Surge Model (V1) with parameterized logic and feature_flag support. Pilot in zones 51 & 4 for 2 weeks. If on-time improves ≥5%, scale. If not, adjust parameters or revert old logic for these zones.
- F-02: Simplified Math Model (V2) after V1 success. If wait times reduce by an additional 3% and no compliance issues, proceed city-wide incrementally.
- F-03: Predictive Surge Enhancements (V3-ready): Prepare pipelines with rainfall, price search data. Once stable, A/B test ML-driven approach. If ML underperforms, revert to V2

Each feature is not final until tested and validated. If a feature fails A/B tests or user surveys, reprioritize using WSJF, refine parameters (e.g., surge_high_tier_rate), and retest next PI.

---

### 6. Detailed Requirements (FRs, NFRs, User Stories, Acceptance Criteria)

**Functional Requirements (FRs):**

1. **FR1 (Cell-Level Surge Calculation):**  
   - Every 5 min, recalculate surge per H3 cell. If demand > supply by >10%, increase surge using parameter additional_surge_high.  
   - Acceptance: In pilot A/B test, if on-time improves by ≥5% vs. control. If not achieved, adjust unmet_rate thresholds next PI or revert logic in test zones.

2. **FR2 (Feature_Flag & Parameter Control):**  
   - If feature_flag=0, use old logic; if feature_flag=1, use new parameter-driven logic for specified zones (e.g., 51,4) and time intervals.  
   - Acceptance: If compliance or user feedback negative, revert to old logic within 1 hour. Document changes and fix parameters offline.

3. **FR3 (Rider Fare Transparency):**  
   - Show “Why this fare?” and test short animation vs. text tooltips.  
   - Acceptance: If abandonment reduces by ≥2%, adopt best variant globally next increment. If <2%, try different messaging or add localized examples.

4. **FR4 (Driver Incentive Dashboard):**  
   - Weekly earnings summary + recommended peak hours.  
   - Acceptance: If ≥80% drivers find it helpful in pilot survey, scale city-wide. If not, adjust visuals or add time-slot filtering next PI.

5. **FR5 (Compliance Triggers):**  
   - If local max surge =1.5x exceeded, log event, alert Compliance Officer, and revert logic or apply stricter parameters within ≤1h.  
   - Acceptance: Zero unresolved compliance violations after fallback. If any recurring, add compliance rule hardcoding next PI.

**Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs):**
- **Performance:** Surge API <2s under 10x load; if tests fail, optimize or block release.  
- **Scalability:** Support 100k drivers & 1M daily rides by Year 2. If expansions slow performance, add caching, scale horizontally.  
- **Security & Compliance:** OAuth 2.0, encryption, quarterly pen tests. Any pen test fail = fix before next release.  
- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance. If any violation, block launch until fixed.  
- **Reliability:** 99.9% uptime, RTO<4h with monthly failover drills. If failover test fails, fix and retest before expansions.

**User Stories & Acceptance Criteria:**
- **US-E01-01 (Rider Surge Display):** If variation with animation reduces abandonment ≥2% vs. control, adopt animation. If not, try simpler text next PI.
- **US-E02-05 (Zone-Specific Parameters):** As an Ops Manager, if a zone’s (e.g., 51) feedback is negative, update zone’s parameters within 1 day. If no improvement after next iteration, revert feature_flag=0.

**Validation & Loopholes:**
Every FR and story ties to clear metrics. If unmet, we know exactly how to pivot (tweak parameters, revert logic, retest). Detailed acceptance criteria and fallback logic ensure no scenario leaves us stranded.

---

### 7. Data & Analytics Integration

Data underpins iterative validation and outcome-driven improvements. We ensure that every decision—tweaking unmet_rate or adjusting surge caps—is grounded in robust, near-real-time and historical data.

**Data Flows:**
- Collect cell-level demand/supply, rainfall, price searches every 5 min.  
- ETL ensures <1% discrepancy. If >1%, run remediation job immediately. If recurring >3 times, escalate to Data Eng Manager and block expansions until fixed.

**ML Pipeline & Governance:**
- Even if V5.2 ML is future, we start accumulating enough high-quality data for when we’re ready. If model drift occurs later, revert to simpler logic (V5.1 or old logic) until ML is retrained and tested.

**A/B Testing & Analytics Tools:**
- A/B test different parameter sets (e.g., surge_high_tier_rate=0.4 vs. 0.5) and measure difference in acceptance or NPS.  
- Dashboards (Tableau, Looker) show zone-level KPIs. If a particular zone lags behind, investigate if local parameters need adjusting or if rainfall correlation missed.

By embedding analytics deeply, we ensure no guesswork. Each iteration can be justified by data, and if data reveals unexpected patterns, we adapt parameters or revert logic next PI.

---

### 8. Engineering & Architecture Overview

**Architecture Goals:**
Enable rapid changes—e.g., toggling feature_flag, updating parameters for a zone—without downtime, ensuring stable performance and easy scaling.

**Key Enhancements:**
- Microservices for pricing logic, compliance checks, data ingestion.  
- Versioned APIs ensure backward compatibility for at least 2 releases, so if a compliance-driven model emerges, we integrate seamlessly without breaking existing flows.
- CI/CD pipelines ensure every commit is tested. If performance dips, add caching layers or refine indexing before merging. If a pen test reveals vulnerability, fix immediately.

**Scalability & Reliability:**
- If scaling to 30% city coverage triggers latency >2s, horizontally scale pricing microservice pods, or add a read-replica DB.  
- Regular DR drills ensure we never get caught off-guard. If a DR drill fails, fix root causes before next increment.

**Integration with ML:**
- Designed so that plugging in ML-driven V5.2 model is a matter of adding another microservice or endpoint. If ML fails, revert to old logic instantly. This ensures no complexity sacrifices user trust or compliance.

---

### 9. QA & Test Automation

QA validates that every release meets performance, security, accessibility, and compliance thresholds, and that fallback logic works as intended.

**Testing Rigor:**
- Unit tests mock rainfall/price data to ensure surge adjusts correctly. If infiltration tests show no model adaptation under sudden demand, fail the build, require parameter tuning.
- SIT includes load tests at 10x normal load. If fail, block release and fix.  
- Accessibility checks ensure no user is disadvantaged, building brand trust and avoiding regulatory backlash for inaccessibility.

**UAT & Pilots:**
- If UAT in pilot zones show no improvement in on-time after 2 weeks, do not scale. Adjust parameters, retest. If compliance or brand issues appear, also fix before next increment.
  
**Continuous Improvement:**
- Defects must be addressed promptly (P1 in <24h). After each release, QA leads a retrospective to identify if test coverage missed any scenario. If missed, add new tests next PI. This iterative improvement ensures no quality loophole persists beyond one increment.

---

### 10. Branding, UX & CX Alignment

**Brand Integration:**
We ensure that every pricing change aligns with brand values: reliability (explain surges properly), fairness (adjust surge parameters promptly if feedback negative), innovation (pilot new UI elements, short animations).

**UX Strategies:**
- If a 10s animation explanation fails to reduce abandonment by ≥2%, next PI tries a static infographic or simpler wording. Always testing variants ensures we never rely on guesswork.

**Crisis & Communication Plans:**
- If social media backlash occurs due to a misunderstood surge event in a test zone, revert logic within 1 hour, issue a branded statement emphasizing fairness and planned improvements.  
- Marketing aligns campaigns with each pilot. If city expansion fails, marketing tailors localized messaging or clarifies how local conditions affect pricing.

**Validating Brand & UX Success:**
- Monthly brand surveys and NPS track perception. If brand trust doesn’t improve, try more localized user education or highlight fallback logic in communications to reassure users we respond to feedback rapidly.

---
## 11. Marketing & GTM Integration

**GTM Goals:**  
- Increase rider adoption and driver sign-ups in pilot city by 10% pre-MVP.  
- Educate riders on surge logic, improving acceptance of surge rides by at least 2% post-launch.
- Post-MVP, run referral campaigns: track referral conversion. If referrals add 5% more riders in a month, scale promotion.

**GTM Channels & Collateral:**  
- **Pre-Launch Campaigns:**  
  - Blog posts explaining new surge logic.  
  - Short video ads on social media (30s animations showing how we ensure fair pricing).
- **Launch Week Promotions:**  
  - Rider discounts during peak times to test price elasticity. If ridership +10% at peak hours, consider making discounts periodic.  
  - Driver sign-up bonuses: If driver supply in new city lags, increase bonus by 20% until target supply met.

**Brand & Marketing Alignment:**  
- All marketing materials reviewed by Brand Manager for tone and consistency.  
- Crisis Management: If a safety incident goes public, we have a PR template ready—acknowledge issue, outline steps taken, reaffirm safety commitment. Test messaging on internal teams first.

**Measuring GTM Success:**  
- Track CTR on blog posts, social ads. If CTR <1%, adjust messaging or targeting.  
- Measure NPS uplift quarterly. If after 3 months NPS < +3 points (vs. target +10), investigate if marketing messages are unclear or incentives inadequate.

## 12. Operations & Compliance Considerations

**Driver Onboarding & Verification:**  
- Steps: ID upload → background check API call → insurance validation → compliance officer review if needed. If fail steps, driver receives automated rejection email with next steps.
- Target onboarding time: <24h from submission to final decision. If backlog grows, add temporary ops support or automate certain checks.

**Support & Escalation Protocols:**  
- Tiered Support:  
  - L1 handles FAQs (ETAs, payment issues).  
  - L2 handles complex disputes (fare disputes, missed incentives).  
  - L3 (Legal/Compliance) handles regulatory or safety incidents.  
- SLA: L1 resolves 80% tickets <2h. If >5% tickets escalate to L2 due to unclear policies, revise L1 training materials.

**Regulatory Adaptation:**  
- Maintain a compliance backlog: If new law demands driver medical checks, add Medical Check Feature to compliance epic. Target adaptation in <2 weeks.
- Monitor local news feeds. If strike or festival predicted, pre-emptively adjust incentives or limit surge cap to comply with temporary local govt directives.

## 13. Risk Management & Trade-Offs

**Key Risks & Mitigations:**

| Risk                                   | Mitigation                                                             |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Integration failures with external APIs | Sandbox testing pre-launch; fallback pricing logic if external API down |
| ML model underperformance               | Monthly retraining, drift detection alerts, rollback to previous stable model |
| Low user adoption                       | Additional tutorials, refine UI, increase driver/rider promotions, do targeted interviews to identify friction points |
| Regulatory changes                      | Modular compliance rules, 2-week SLA to adapt, maintain legal templates |
| Performance bottlenecks                 | Autoscaling, caching, monthly load tests. If tests show response >2s, invest in DB indexing or rewrite slow queries |

**Trade-Off Examples:**
- **Speed vs. Feature Completeness:** Better to pilot fewer features with high reliability than launch many half-baked. If MVP date nears and surge UI animation not stable, launch with text tooltip only.
- **Cost vs. Earnings Stability:** If driver turnover too high, slightly increase incentive budget short-term. Test if turnover drops; if yes, keep higher incentives until ML suggests stable supply.

**Scenario Handling:**
- If after 2 months on-time improvement <3% (vs. 5% target), run a root cause workshop. Maybe surge thresholds too low—adjust model or expand driver incentives.  
- If local government in City B caps surge at 1.2x, adapt pricing service in <2 weeks, test compliance with simulated requests.

## 14. Roadmap & Timelines (SAFe-Aligned)

| PI (2.5 Months) | Key Deliverables                                  | Goals & Metrics                                                |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| PI-1 (Months 1-2.5) | Basic surge (F-01), partial safety checks (F-02), pilot city A/B test for pricing UI | Validate feasibility, +5% on-time in pilot city after 1 month |
| PI-2 (Months 2.5-5) | Enhanced surge model (F-03), driver dashboard (F-04), ETAs refined, first data pipeline QA pass | On-time +10%, wait times -8%, stable ETL (<1% errors) |
| MVP (Month 5)   | Launch MVP company-wide, run initial marketing push, training done | Achieve +5% on-time co-wide in 1 month, NPS +3 pts vs baseline |
| PI-3 (Months 5-7.5)| Advanced safety features (F-05), first city expansion (#1), improved compliance processes | Zero violations, stable performance in new city, driver turnover -5% |
| PI-4 (Months 7.5-10)| Predictive analytics (F-06), 2 more city expansions (#2 & #3), marketing campaigns | Predictive accuracy >80%, NPS +10 total, 3 cities live |
| PI-5 (Months 10-12.5)| Optimize ML models (F-07), scaling enhancements, add local payment methods, refine brand messaging | Sustain 95% on-time, driver turnover -15%, stable brand perception |

**Inspect & Adapt Each PI:**  
If at PI-1 end on-time gain <3%, re-prioritize next features (improve surge model or driver incentives first?). If expansions show regulatory hurdles, assign dedicated compliance sprints.

---

## 15. Iteration & Feedback Loops

**Mechanisms for Continuous Improvement:**
- **Pilot Tests:** Start each new feature in one pilot city. If results positive (≥5% improvement in metric), scale next PI.
- **A/B Tests:** For each significant UI or incentive change, run A/B test for 2 weeks, measure statistical significance (p<0.05). If variant outperforms control by ≥2% on target metric, adopt it.
- **User Interviews & Surveys:** Monthly sessions with a rotating panel of riders & drivers. Track qualitative feedback in Miro boards. If recurring complaints about surge fairness emerge, prioritize next sprint to improve explanations.
- **Backlog Refinement with WSJF:** Quarterly WSJF scoring sessions align features to outcomes. If a low-value cosmetic feature competes with a predictive analytics improvement that can boost on-time rates, pick the analytics improvement first.
- **Data-Driven Decision-Making:** Ongoing correlation analysis between NPS and metrics like wait times or pricing. If correlation shows pricing transparency strongly tied to NPS, allocate more resources to simplifying price UI next PI.

**Artifacts/References:**  
- Feedback Repository: “product/feedback_log.md” logs user comments, A/B test results, pilot outcomes.  
- Backlog in Jira: Contains WSJF scores for top 20 features each quarter.
