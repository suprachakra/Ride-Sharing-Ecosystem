### 8. Data & Analytics Integration

Data underpins iterative validation and outcome-driven improvements. We ensure that every decision—tweaking unmet_rate or adjusting surge caps—is grounded in robust, near-real-time and historical data.

**Data Flows:**
- Collect cell-level demand/supply, rainfall, price searches every 5 min.  
- ETL ensures <1% discrepancy. If >1%, run remediation job immediately. If recurring >3 times, escalate to Data Eng Manager and block expansions until fixed.

**ML Pipeline & Governance:**
- Even if this is for future, we start accumulating enough high-quality data for when we’re ready. If model drift occurs later, revert to simpler logic until ML is retrained and tested.

**A/B Testing & Analytics Tools:**
- A/B test different parameter sets (e.g., surge_high_tier_rate=0.4 vs. 0.5) and measure difference in acceptance or NPS.  
- Dashboards (Tableau, Looker) show zone-level KPIs. If a particular zone lags behind, investigate if local parameters need adjusting or if weather correlation missed. Surges or discount levels tested in pilot areas. 

By embedding analytics deeply, we ensure no guesswork. Each iteration can be justified by data, and if data reveals unexpected patterns, we adapt parameters or revert logic next PI.
