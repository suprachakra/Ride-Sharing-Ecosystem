### 12. Marketing & GTM Integration 

**Purpose & Strategic Fit:**  
Marketing and GTM efforts ensure that users (riders, drivers) understand changes, trust the platform, and adopt ride-sharing features. This epic aligns directly with NPS improvements (OKR4) and growth targets. If marketing fails to raise adoption or clarify surge logic, we iterate messaging, test alternative campaigns, or add localized examples next increment.

**GTM Goals:**  
- Increase rider adoption and driver sign-ups in the pilot city by 10% pre-MVP. If short of target, test different promotional angles or timing next PI.  
- Educate riders on ride-sharing logic to boost acceptance of rides by ≥2% post-launch. If not achieved, simplify explanations, add animations or tutorials next increment.  
- After MVP, run campaigns: if referrals add ≥5% more riders in 1 month, scale that promotion city-wide. If <5%, try alternate referral incentives or messaging next PI.

**GTM Channels & Collateral:**
- **Pre-Launch Campaigns:**  
  - Blog posts explaining cost-sharing fairness and adaptability.  
  - Short social media video ads (30s animation) showcasing how we ensure ethical pricing. If CTR <1%, tweak visuals or copy next cycle.
  
- **Launch Week Promotions:**  
  - Rider discounts during peak hours: If ridership +10% at these hours, consider periodic discounts. If not, test different discount structures next PI.  
  - Driver sign-up bonuses: If driver supply lags in a new city, increase bonus by 20%. If still no improvement after 2 weeks, test region-specific driver incentives or different communication channels.

**Brand & Marketing Alignment:**
- All marketing materials undergo brand manager review for tone, consistency, and cultural sensitivity. If brand audits show confusion after 2 weeks, revise messaging.  
- Crisis Management: If a safety or compliance issue goes public, deploy pre-approved PR templates acknowledging the issue, steps taken, and reaffirming safety commitment. Test internal teams’ response readiness monthly.

**Educating and Promoting Ride-Pooling**
- Short In-App Videos/Animations: A 10-second explainer (“Share to Save”) clarifying how a passenger can save up to 25% and see only a moderate detour (+5–8 minutes).
- Localized Campaigns: Highlight “Green Travel” or “Carpool for Less Traffic” in certain high-density zones. If CTR <2%, refine messaging or test a flash discount (e.g., “Extra 5% off if you share rides from 4–7 PM this weekend”).
- Awareness Partnerships: Collaborate with local events or environmental groups to position ride-pooling as a socially conscious option. If usage doesn’t rise ≥3% after a 2-week trial, pivot to standard brand-lift ads focusing on convenience.

**Measuring GTM Success:**
- Track CTR on blog posts, social ads weekly. If CTR <1%, test alternate headlines or images next increment.  
- Measure NPS uplift quarterly. If after 3 months NPS < +3 points (vs. target +10), identify if marketing messages are unclear or if incentives fail to resonate. Adjust and retest next PI.
