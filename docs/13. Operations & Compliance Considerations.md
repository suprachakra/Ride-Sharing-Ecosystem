### 13. Operations & Compliance Considerations

**Operational Excellence & Compliance Integrity:**
Operations ensure daily smooth functioning—driver onboarding, support resolution, parameter updates—while compliance maintains zero violations and ethical adherence. Both drive trust and brand reputation.

**Operational Readiness:**
- Training programs for drivers on multi-passenger pick-ups, route changes, in-app instructions.  
- Customer support scripting for co-rider disputes or seat changes.

**Support & Escalation Protocols:**
- Tiered Support: L1 (FAQs, ETAs), L2 (complex fare disputes), L3 (legal/compliance incidents).  
- SLA: L1 resolves 80% tickets <2h. If more than 5% escalate to L2 due to unclear policies, revise L1 training materials next iteration.  
- If surge confusion persists in support logs, feed insights to backlog (improve “Why fare?” UI or parameters next PI).

**Driver Management**  
- Potential new incentive or pay structure if multiple passengers are onboard.  
- Monitoring driver performance, rating system adapted to multiple co-riders.

**Regulatory Adaptation:**
- Maintain a compliance backlog: If a city enforces max surge =1.2x, reflect in config, revert logic if needed, and retest next increment.
- RTA/LTA or local transport authority approvals if private vehicles are allowed.  
- If local events (strikes/festivals) affect demand, preemptively adjust incentives or surge parameters to comply with temporary directives. If results don’t improve NPS or acceptance, refine further next PI.
- Legal framework for insurance coverage and liability in multi-rider trips.

**Artifacts/References:**
- Compliance Dashboard (“ops/compliance_dashboard”) for live alerts, driver doc status. If repeated compliance alerts occur, escalate and fix immediately.  
- Support Playbook (“ops/support_playbook.pdf”) for standardized responses. If certain queries keep recurring, update playbook or improve UI messaging next increment.

**In-Cab Surveillance & RTA Regulations:**
All rides must comply with real-time camera/GPS feed requirements mandated by regulatory. For pooled rides:
- If a camera malfunctions mid-trip, the system restricts new pickups to safeguard passenger safety and maintain compliance. 
- If repeated camera failures occur, the driver reverts to private-only mode until resolved.
