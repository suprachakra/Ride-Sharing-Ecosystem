### 14. Risk Management & Trade-Offs

**Comprehensive Risk Handling:**
We have fallback logic, compliance checks, pilot tests, and scenario-based parameter adjustments. This section explicitly details the risk register and trade-offs, ensuring no scenario lacks a mitigation plan.

**Key Risks & Mitigations:**

| Risk                                   | Mitigation                                                           |
|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Integration failures (APIs, data)       | Sandbox testing pre-launch, fallback to baseline pricing if external feed down. If failure persists, test alternate data sources next PI. |
| Low user adoption or NPS shortfall      | Refine UX messaging, run targeted interviews, test alternate incentives. If still low, add localized educational material or simpler pricing explanations next PI. |
| Regulatory changes mid-PI               | Modular compliance rules, adapt in <2 weeks. If urgent, revert logic ≤1h. Hardcode rules if recurring. |
| Performance bottlenecks                 | Autoscaling, caching, monthly load tests. If >2s response, tune DB indexing or queries next PI.

**Trade-Off Examples:**
- **Speed vs. Completeness:**  
  If close to MVP and animation for “Why fare?” not stable, launch with tooltip only. If metrics don’t improve, add animation next PI.

- **Event Surge Management:**
For large-scale events (e.g., Expo, GITEX, DSF) with predicted demand spikes:
- Enable advanced surge logic in those zones, combined with short-term driver incentives (e.g., extra $ X per completed trip).
- If occupancy or driver supply does not meet targets, revert to stable surges or partial pooling logic to avoid user frustration.
- Post-event, run a 2-week retrospective to measure driver earnings and rider satisfaction before scaling citywide again.
  
- **Cost vs. Earnings Stability:**
  If driver turnover high, temporarily increase incentives. Check next 2-week pilot. If no improvement, consider non-monetary driver perks or better scheduling tips.

Every risk has a clearly defined fallback or iterative improvement route. Regular Inspect & Adapt sessions ensure no known risk remains unmanaged.
