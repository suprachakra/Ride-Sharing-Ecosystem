### 6. Epics & Strategic Alignment

**Epics & Their Justification:**  
Each Epic directly supports OKRs and strategic pillars by addressing rider/driver needs, ensuring compliance, enhancing data capabilities, scaling operations, and maintaining brand trust.

| Epic ID | Epic Name                         | Strategic/Outcome Alignment                                     |
|---------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| E-01    | Dynamic Pricing & Dispatch         | Directly improves on-time performance (OKR1) and efficiency (OKR2). Embeds logic for ride-sharing surges and seat-based dispatch. |
| E-02    | Transparency & UX Enhancements     | Increases NPS (OKR3 and OKR4) by reducing rider confusion. “Why this fare?” explanations and A/B-tested UI changes ensure trust and fairness. If metrics don’t improve, pivot messaging next increment. |
| E-03    | Driver Incentive Optimization      | Reduces driver turnover (OKR4) by offering stable earning forecasts and intuitive dashboards. If driver satisfaction <80%, adjust incentive display logic or add visuals next PI. |
| E-04    | Data Governance & ML Readiness     | Critical for future AI-driven pricing, ensuring data accuracy and integrity. If ETL errors >1%, fix before next release.  |
| E-05    | Compliance & Risk Mitigation       | Ensures zero violations (OKR3) and quick adaptation to local laws. If a new rule appears, implement in <2 weeks or revert to old logic. Regular compliance checks prevent brand/reputational damage. |
| E-06    | Marketing & GTM Integration         | Drives user adoption and brand message alignment, supporting efficiency/NPS improvements. If marketing campaigns fail (e.g., CTR <1%), test alternate messaging or promotions next PI. |
| E-07    | QA & Test Automation Framework     | Indirectly supports all OKRs by preventing regressions. Comprehensive testing (performance, security, accessibility) ensures stable deployments. If tests fail, block release, fix defects, retest. |
| E-08    | Scalability & Localization          | Essential for expansions (OKR5). Localizing payment methods, languages, and compliance rules. If a city launch fails KPI targets, refine local parameters, re-test before further rollout. |
| E-09    | Compliance & Risk Management        | Rapidly adapt pricing rules to new regulations or user backlash. Fallback logic (feature_flag=0) ensures we never linger in a non-compliant or user-unfriendly state. |

**Feature Examples Under E-01 (Dynamic Pricing):**

- **F-01**: Baseline Surge Model with parameter logic and feature_flag for pilot areas.  
- **F-02**: Simplified Carpooling Logic post-Baseline success. If wait times drop another 3% with no compliance issues, expand citywide.  
- **F-03**: Predictive Enhancements (optional AI). If ML underperforms, revert to simpler logic.


Each feature is not final until tested and validated. If a feature fails A/B tests or user surveys, reprioritize using WSJF, refine parameters (e.g., surge_high_tier_rate), and retest next PI.
