### 4. Objectives & Key Results (OKRs)

We set OKRs to ensure that every feature, parameter tweak, and fallback decision ties directly to measurable outcomes. These OKRs are not static: if we fail to meet targets, we adjust strategy, backlog, or parameters (like unmet_rate thresholds or surge_high_tier_rate) in subsequent increments.

| **Objective**                                                                                                  | **Key Result**                                                                                                             | **Additional Notes**                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **OKR1: Maintain/Improve Existing Revenue** <br> *Avoid BAU revenue drop while introducing carpool pilots*    | 1. **0% revenue dip** for BAU services during first 3 months of carpool pilot<br>2. **+2% overall revenue growth** by end of pilot if carpool is well-received   | - Monitor daily/weekly revenue to ensure pilot doesn't cannibalize existing demand.<br>- Offer stable or minimal surcharges in pilot zones to maintain rider loyalty.<br>- Revisit fare structure if revenue dips below baseline for >2 weeks.   |
| **OKR2: Validate Carpooling in in Selected Pilot Areas** <br> *Prove feasibility before citywide rollout*               | 1. **≥15%** of rides in pilot zones are pooled within 3 months<br>2. **95% driver acceptance** for pooling requests in pilot areas                               | - Restrict pilot to 1–2 carefully selected pilot zones.<br>- Provide driver incentives for multi-passenger trips.<br>- If acceptance <10% after 2 months, refine matching algorithm or incentives.               |
| **OKR3: Ensure On-Time Performance & User Satisfaction** <br> *No negative operational impact from pilot*      | 1. **On-time pickups remain ≥90%** in pilot zones (equal to BAU) <br>2. **NPS** for pooled rides is **≥+5 points** above baseline by quarter’s end               | - Track arrival times vs. BAU in pilot zones.<br>- Use A/B tests to refine “Why this fare?” or cost-sharing explanations.<br>- If NPS stalls, implement improved in-app carpool tutorials or adjust seat limits.                             |
| **OKR4: Structured Release & Scale-Up** <br> *Gradual expansion strategy*                                      | 1. **Phase 1** pilot in small zones **by Month 6** <br>2. **Phase 2** citywide rollout once pilot meets ≥80% KPI targets <br>3. Achieve citywide coverage **by Month 12**  | - Use SAFe increments: each increment includes new    zones if pilot metrics (OKR2, OKR3) are satisfied.<br>- Document release retros in each PI to address any compliance or operational snags.<br>- If major issues occur, revert to BAU for those zones. |


**Real-World Validation & Iterative Adjustments:**  
- **If Pooling Adoption Lags (OKR2):**  
  - Revisit pooling incentives for drivers or reduce passenger match limits during peak times.  
  - Use WSJF scoring to prioritize match-making refinements next increment.  

- **If Rider NPS Stagnates (OKR4):**  
  - Investigate specific pooling complaints (e.g., unclear cost breakdowns).  
  - Test alternative UX flows for pooling cost-sharing explanations.  

- **If Pooling Wait Times Exceed 10 Minutes (OKR1):**  
  - Adjust pooling thresholds dynamically or allow fallback to single-rider fares.  

By linking outcomes to data-driven decision-making, we ensure no “What if?” scenario is ignored. Each KPI acts as a gate: if not met, do not scale or proceed; refine first.
