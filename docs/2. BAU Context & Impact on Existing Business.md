### 2. BAU Context & Impact on Existing Business

#### **Current BAU Overview**  
   - Summarize existing service: daily rides, average revenue per ride, driver supply, key user segments (airport runs, business, tourism, etc.).

#### **Risk of Cannibalization**  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>   - **Permissible Dip**: Define an acceptable revenue dip from single-rider trips if users switch to cheaper shared rides (e.g., maximum 5–10%).  
>   - **Monitoring Mechanism**: Outline how financial dashboards track daily/weekly shifts from single to shared rides.

#### **Mitigation Strategies**  
   - Gradual rollout of carpooling in certain corridors/times to limit BAU disruption.  
   - Potential to upsell additional services (premium single-rider experiences) to balance out any cannibalization.
   - Adjusting carpool availability (limiting certain hours/areas) if cannibalization is too high.
   - Special discounts or loyalty perks for single-ride customers to retain them.

#### **Alignment with Company KPIs**  
   - Ensure the new carpooling initiative doesn’t hinder existing strategic priorities (e.g., brand equity, driver satisfaction, etc.).

#### **Definition of Permissible Dip**
   - Hard thresholds (e.g., 5% single-ride revenue erosion vs. forecast).
   - Agreement that if we exceed that threshold, we re-evaluate or adapt promotions.

#### **Dashboards & Alerts**
   - Daily or weekly reporting on single vs. shared ride usage, revenue per trip.
   - Automated alerts to finance/strategy leads if metrics cross red lines.
