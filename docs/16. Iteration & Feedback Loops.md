### 16. Iteration & Feedback Loops

**Continuous Improvement Culture:**
We embed feedback loops at all levels: user interviews, pilot tests, A/B tests, monthly surveys, compliance audits, QA retrospectives, and brand audits. If results deviate from targets, we adapt next PI—no waiting months to fix known issues.

**Mechanisms for Improvement:**
- **Pilot Tests:** Start with small scale. If success, scale next PI. If failure, tweak parameters or revert logic.  
- **A/B Tests:** For each UI or incentive variant, run 2-week test, measure statistically. If variant outperforms control, adopt next increment. If not, try alternate variant next PI.
- **User Interviews & Surveys:** Monthly sessions reveal pain points. If confusion persists about surge, simplify explanations or add localized analogies next PI.
- **Data-Driven Backlog Refinement (WSJF):** Quarterly WSJF scoring ensures we pick features with highest impact on OKRs. If no progress on NPS after 2 increments, prioritize UX or incentive improvements next cycle.
- **Integration with SAFe PIs:** After each PI, Inspect & Adapt workshop identifies what worked, what didn’t. Rapid response ensures no known issue stagnates.
