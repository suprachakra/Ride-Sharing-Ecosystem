## 23. Disaster Scenarios & Macro-Environmental Changes

**Strategic Context:**  
Major disruptions—economic recessions, pandemics, or competitor price wars—can shatter standard ridership assumptions. A future-proof marketplace strategy must define how we maintain financial and operational stability under these shocks. This section codifies fallback approaches for each major disruptive scenario.

#### 23.1 Economic Downturn Response

**Demand Elasticity & Price Adjustments:**  
If overall ridership dips ≥10% for 2+ months, we test stable or reduced surges to keep rides affordable, preserving partial revenue flow. If driver supply also dips, we might offer guaranteed hours in certain high-need zones. We track whether these expansions push overhead beyond +1% of budget. If so, revert or refine next PI.

**Cost Control & Survival Mode:**  
If monthly margin strays by >3% from plan across 2 consecutive months, we freeze expansions, reduce marketing, or even temporarily scale back advanced ML if it drains resources. Once the crisis passes and key metrics (rides, margin) recover, we gradually re-introduce expansions.

**Pooling-Specific Risks & Mitigations:**
- High Demand + Limited Drivers: If drivers refuse pooled trips during peak surges, re-check incentive structure or temporarily revert to private-only in certain zones (feature_flag=0).
- Passenger Dissatisfaction with Extra Stops: If user feedback indicates drop in NPS, reduce the discount threshold (e.g., from 25% to 20%) but cap the maximum detour at 5 minutes instead of 8.


#### 23.2 Public Health Crises (Pandemic-Like)

**Safety Measures & Brand Reassurance:**  
We might reduce carpool offerings or highlight driver safety kits. If competitor is slower to adapt, that brand gap can help us. If user fear still decimates ridership, pivot resources to essential rides, local deliveries, or partnership with local government for subsidized transport. Each pivot is tested in pilot zones first, so if overhead or user interest is too low, we revert promptly.

**Driver Support & Scheduling Flexibility:**  
In a prolonged public health scenario, some drivers may avoid work. We can try short-term illness compensation or flexible scheduling. If these measures balloon costs beyond 2% monthly margin, scale back or seek partial government relief. Balancing goodwill with financial sustainability ensures brand trust.

#### 23.3 Macro-Level Mobility Shifts & Competitor Price Wars

**Micro-Mobility or Alternative Modes:**  
If e-scooters or bike shares siphon short-distance trips, we refocus on mid/long routes or build alliances with micro-mobility providers for last-mile synergy. If synergy yields +5% in integrated usage, keep it. If brand confusion or adoption <2%, revert to classic taxi focus.

**Severe Competitor Discounts:**  
If a competitor slashes fares by >15% city-wide for >2 weeks, we can pilot stable fares or mild discount codes for riders in that zone, measuring churn or margin hits. If churn remains low, we remain premium. If churn >5%, ramp up brand-lift ads or partial price matches in 1–2 key zones, then reevaluate after 2–4 weeks.
