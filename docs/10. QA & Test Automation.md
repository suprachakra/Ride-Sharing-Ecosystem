### 10. QA & Test Automation

QA validates that every release meets performance, security, accessibility, and compliance thresholds, and that fallback logic works as intended.

**Testing Rigor:**
- Unit tests mock rainfall/price data to ensure surge adjusts correctly. If infiltration tests show no model adaptation under sudden demand, fail the build, require parameter tuning.
- SIT includes load tests at 10x normal load. If fail, block release and fix.
- Performance & Load Testing, simulates peak commuter hours.  
- Security Testing, Penetration testing, code scans for vulnerabilities.
- Accessibility checks ensure no user is disadvantaged, building brand trust and avoiding regulatory backlash for inaccessibility.

**Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**  
- Automated test suites triggered upon each code commit.  
- Canary or staged rollouts to detect issues early.

**UAT & Pilots:**
- Beta release to internal users or a small pilot group before citywide rollout.  
- Collect feedback on user flows, route accuracy, comfort with co-riders.
- If UAT in pilot zones show no improvement in on-time after 3 weeks, do not scale. Adjust parameters, retest. If compliance or brand issues appear, also fix before next increment.
  
**Continuous Improvement:**
- Defects must be addressed promptly (P1 in <24h). After each release, QA leads a retrospective to identify if test coverage missed any scenario. If missed, add new tests next PI. This iterative improvement
- ensures no quality loophole persists beyond one increment.
