## 25. Cost Structures & Resource Allocation Planning

**Strategic Context:**  
We have touched on horizontal scaling or ops staff additions if onboarding lags, but a Head of Marketplace often demands a **detailed budgeting framework** that clarifies exactly how much is allocated to incentives, marketing, QA improvements, compliance overhead, data engineering, and so forth—ensuring no hidden cost spikes or margin surprises.

#### 25.1 Budgeting Guidelines per SAFe PI

**Incentives, Marketing, QA, & Data Engineering:**  
For each PI (e.g., 2.5-month cycle), we define spending caps or ranges:

- **Incentive Budget** (e.g., 40% of total funds for driver/rider bonuses) to ensure we don’t overshoot margin if competitor sign-up deals appear. If competitor invests heavily in driver sign-ups, we might temporarily add 10% more to the incentive budget, yet still remain within overall PI cost ceilings.  
- **Marketing & Branding** (e.g., 25% of total budget) for brand-lift campaigns, discount codes, or city expansions. If brand synergy lags or competitor undercut demands more marketing, we re-allocate from less critical items (like minor UI polish) to marketing, capping the shift at 5% to avoid stalling essential DevOps or QA tasks.

**QA & Engineering Overhead:**  
We note that each new feature or pilot demands extra test cycles and possible infrastructure upgrades. If we see a jump in DevOps costs by >2% in a single PI due to advanced ML computations, we either optimize usage or scale back that ML pilot until cost stabilizes. The same logic applies if QA backlog inflates—maybe we slow feature rollouts or automate more tests to manage overhead.

#### 25.2 Contingency & Flex Budgets

**Compliance Surges or Data Engineering Fires:**  
We keep a contingency buffer (e.g., 10% of total spend per PI) for urgent compliance mandates (like local licensing changes) or data pipeline issues (like repeated ETL discrepancies). If we burn >50% of that buffer mid-PI, we freeze any non-critical expansions or UI enhancements to preserve margin.

**Staff Resourcing:**  
If driver onboarding or compliance tasks double unexpectedly, we can add temps or partial staff reassignments. If this overhead exceeds 1% monthly margin for 2 consecutive months, we scale back expansions or reduce certain marketing outlays.

#### 25.3 Integrating These Plans with Product & Ops

Each backlog item now references a cost line (e.g., “+2% marketing budget for sign-up codes in City A,” “+1 staff for compliance checks”). If the cost-risk ratio is too high (like adding staff overshadowing potential margin improvements), the item is deprioritized unless validated by a critical scenario (like major churn risk). This ensures **no hidden cost** emerges from well-meaning expansions or features.
