### 9. Engineering & Architecture Overview

**Architecture Goals:**
Enable rapid changes—e.g., toggling feature_flag, updating parameters for a zone—without downtime, ensuring stable performance and easy scaling.

**Key Enhancements:**
- Microservices for pricing logic, compliance checks, data ingestion, booking, trip, vehicles, user management, payment processing, analytics  
- Versioned APIs ensure backward compatibility for at least 2 releases, so if a compliance-driven model emerges, we integrate seamlessly without breaking existing flows.
- Dispatch for Carpool and Matching Engine services using location-based algorithms.
- CI/CD pipelines ensure every commit is tested. If performance dips, add caching layers or refine indexing before merging. If a pen test reveals vulnerability, fix immediately.

**Third-Party Integrations**  
- Mapping/Navigation APIs (e.g., Google Maps, OpenStreetMap).  
- Payment Gateways & Wallets. (Bank Cards, Digital Wallets, Corporate cards, BNPL) 
- SMS/Push Notification Providers

**Scalability & Reliability:**
- If scaling to 30% city coverage triggers latency >2s, horizontally scale pricing microservice pods, or add a read-replica DB.  
- Regular DR drills ensure we never get caught off-guard. If a DR drill fails, fix root causes before next increment.
- Auto-scaling cloud infrastructure (AWS, Azure, GCP) with multi-region failover.  
- Real-time monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana, Splunk) for anomalies.
- Data Analytics(DataDog)
- Product Analytics(Amplitude, Mixpanel, Clevertap)

**Integration with ML:**
- Designed so that plugging in ML-driven is a matter of adding another microservice or endpoint. If ML fails, revert to old logic instantly. This ensures no complexity sacrifices user trust or compliance.
